ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and monitor the performance of a Hospital Emergency Room (ER).
The goal is to help hospital management make data-driven decisions by tracking patient admissions, referrals, wait times, satisfaction scores, and demographics.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives
->Monitor ER operational efficiency through KPIs.
->Identify peak hours, delays, and bottlenecks.
->Analyze department referrals for resource allocation.
->Track patient satisfaction and demographics.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
->Power BI â€“ Dashboard & Visualization
->Power Query â€“ Data Cleaning & Transformation
->DAX â€“ KPI calculations
->Excel/CSV Dataset â€“ Source data

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Views
->Monthly View â€“ Admissions, wait times, demographics, referrals, satisfaction.
->Consolidated View â€“ Trends across months/years.
->Patient Detail View â€“ Patient-level analysis (ID, gender, age, race, wait time, admission status).
->Key Insights View â€“ Actionable recommendations for hospital management.

ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
->Avg Wait Time: ~35 minutes, with ~58% patients seen within 30 minutes.
->Referrals: Most referrals were to General Practice and Orthopedics.
->Demographics: Balanced gender distribution, with more visits from 20â€“40 age group.
->Satisfaction: Dropped during peak hours, strongly correlated with wait times.

âœ… Output

->Monitoring of patient flow and performance metrics
->Identification of resource gaps in departments
->Improved hospital decision-making with data-driven insights
